            <p class="par">The ideal of a Letranite is nobility, generosity and discipline of the Knight of Old. <br>
                It draws its inspiration from God himself who guides his conduct and orients it towards Himself. <br>
                The Letranite is also man-for-others. His relationship with other people is marked by fairness <br>
                and generosity that flows from the nobility of his heart. <br>
                A Letranite is a faithful witness to the gospel message empowered by his strong relationship with <br>
                the Lord and the teachings of his alma mater. He lives his faith based on sound catholic doctrines.<br>
                Inspired by love of God and love of neighbor, he practices charity and justice to promote peace.<br>
                Called to share in the prophetic role of Christ, continuously propagates and defends the tenets and<br>
                traditions of the church.<br>
                The Letranite is devoted to the Mother of God, whom he reveres and honors. <br>
                His devotion to Our Lady is manifested in more ways than one, the more popular being the Rosary.<br>
                Following a long standing tradition, the Letranite always carries the rosary, which he prays alone,<br>
                with his peers and with his family at home.<br>
                The successful Letranite excels and is recognized in his chosen field of endeavor.<br> 
                He is armed with professional competence to advance the national interest and global competitiveness.<br> 
                In his dealings, he practices fairness at all times. <br>
                He maintains high dignity and integrity in the exercise of his profession.
